### What is convolution?
Convolution is a mathematical operation performed on 2 functions to ouput a 3rd function that expresses how one input is modified by the other.

### And how does convolutions help in neural networks?
The idea comes from how visual cortex in brain interprets from visual inputs from eyes. The visual cortex as 2 types of cells - S(simple) cells and C(complex) cells. Simple cells identify the local part of an image like edges, angles while Complex cells work on top of simple cells to identify the whole image. 

### How does convolutional neural network work?
CNNs have 2 components that do the thing:
1. Hidden layer / feature extraction part
2. Classification part
